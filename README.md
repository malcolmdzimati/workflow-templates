# GitHub Actions Workflow Templates

This repository serves as the **central hub for reusable GitHub Actions workflows across all my GitHub projects**.

It provides pre-configured, modular workflows for tasks including:

- Building and testing frontend and backend applications
- Running linting, formatting, and static analysis
- Deploying to staging and production environments
- Automating dependency updates and security scans

By maintaining these workflows in one place, I ensure:

- Consistent automation pipelines across all projects
- Easier rollout of improvements and fixes across multiple repositories
- Reduced duplication and simplified workflow management
